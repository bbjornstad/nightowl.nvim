  - name: Metacontext
    domainVisionStatement: |
      To describe core component types for my lazyvim configuration in a
      descriptive and accessible way
  - name: Keymapping
    domainVisionStatement: |
      To elucidate certain uses of mathematical terminology as applied to the
      process of defining keymaps for neovim.
    terms:
      - name: Keybind
        definition: |
          conceptually, an item which represents both a sequence of keystrokes
          entered on a keyboard in a Neovim window, together with the associated
          triggered action (plus any metadata such as description, etc.)
        examples:
          - The Keybind { "<leader>fr", function()
            require('telescope.builtin').oldfiles() end, mode = "n", desc =
            "recent files" } is a representation in lazy.nvim spec style
  - name: ObjectOrientation

      - name: Object
        definition: |
          a collection of data conveying certain context or situation-specific

      - name: Class
        definition: |
