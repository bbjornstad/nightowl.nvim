# nightowl.nvim

A neovim configuration of the highest parliamentary order, achievable only through the
intense process of soulbonding (with the editor itself, of course).

A lot of people choose to use vim/neovim because it has the advantage of being configurable
to the point of working well and smoothly on hardware which is not too powerful or
expensive. This is a perfectly valid reason to use the program instead of any
alternatives which are easy to set up, but may suffer from performance issues. And this
is all well and good, but this configuration is not for me, and it does not describe my
own reasoning for using Neovim.
