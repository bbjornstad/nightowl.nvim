INTRODUCTION                                            *nightowl-parliament.nvim*

lazy.nvim is a neovim plugin manager, noteable for many reasons including its
clean code and nicely packaged plugin configurations complete with hands-off
lazy-loading. There could be no other choice to base an implementation such as
this on.

Kickstart.nvim is a project to help you get started on your neovim journey. It
is the minimal base configuration upon which nightowl-parliament.nvim is
built.

LazyVim is a distribution to (among other tasks) get a neovim distribution up
to snuff in a short amount of time, using sensible default choices for plugin
options and keybinding configuration. It was the original starting point for
the first versions of nightowl-parliament.nvim, and serves as an inspiration
and guide on the most ideal methods for configuring lazy.nvim.

nightowl-parliament.nvim is not a distribution per-se, but rather is a
personal attempt at making neovim capable of "doing anything" that I might ask
out of a text editor. It is somewhere in between kickstart.nvim and LazyVim
in terms of its spirit of implementation, but exceeds both in configured
capabilities and takes a slightly more opinionated approach to the
methodical configuration of keybindings.

                                                            *kickstart-is-not*
It is not:
- Complete framework for every plugin under the sun
- Place to add every plugin that could ever be useful

                                                                *kickstart-is*
It is:
- Somewhere that has a good start for the most common "IDE" type features:
    - autocompletion
    - goto-definition
    - find references
    - fuzzy finding
    - and hinting at what more can be done :)
- A place to _kickstart_ your journey.
    - You should fork this project and use/modify it so that it matches your
      style and preferences. If you don't want to do that, there are probably
      other projects that would fit much better for you (and that's great!)!
